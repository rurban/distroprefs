  Weird Makefile.PL. Any arbitrary ARGV will prevent that the question will come where we want to install.

  The default answer to the default install is weird too, so our best
  bet at the moment is to give foobar as argument. This worked with 1.44.

match:
  distribution: 'ABELTJE/Test-Smoke-\d'
pl:
  args:
    - foobar
  expect:
    - 'Where would you like to install Test::Smoke\?'
    - "\n"
